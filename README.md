# FaceRecognitionApp
You can clone this repo and don't need install any other package. This repo intergrated face-api package (https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) 
Usage:  First you set up data in data folder (please set up name file/folder like that I done) for face-api analyze. 
        You also need to update files created in function "loadTrainingData" and index === the number files you created
        Then you start app(should use "live server" extension in VSCode)  and select your picture
Note: The accuracy of the app is based on the amount of data you generate and the second param in function "FaceMatcher" please fix it for suitable for you
